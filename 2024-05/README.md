# 📊 Compression Detection Plot Directory

This directory contains simulation result visualizations and analysis scripts for compression detection experiments, divided into different approaches.

```

### 📂 `delay_based/`
This folder contains result plots and raw data for delay-based compression detection.

**Files include:**
- `*.pdf`: Visualizations of delay results under varying network parameters (e.g., `capacity.pdf`, `queue_size.pdf`)
- `*.txt`: Raw results files for delay analysis (e.g., `rst_delay_results_link.txt`)
- `comprDetect_plot_delay.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to generate plots from delay result data

### 📂 `loss_rate_based/`
Contains loss-rate-based compression detection results and plot scripts.

**Files include:**
- `*.pdf`: Plots of how loss rate changes with compression (e.g., `effectNcompression.pdf`, `packet_size_q1.pdf`)
- `lossrate_output/`, `packet_number/`, `capacity/`: raw data or simulation outputs
- `comprDetect_plot_loss_rate.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to generate plots for loss-rate experiments

### 📂 `multiline_packetNumber/`
Notebook focused on plotting results with multiple lines (e.g., varying packet numbers).

- `multiline_packetnum.ipynb`: Generates line plots for multiple simulation conditions

## 📈 How to Use the Notebooks
You can open and run any of the Jupyter notebooks using:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

Ensure you have `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn` installed (if applicable):

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn
```

These visualizations support understanding how compression affects network behavior under different conditions.

## 🗂️ File Type Explanation
- `.ipynb` files are **notebooks**: they generate plots from the input data.
- `.pdf`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png` files are **result files**: visualizations generated by the notebooks.
- All other files (e.g., `.txt`, folders like `capacity/`, `packet_number/`) are **input data files** used in simulations or plot generation.

You can regenerate the result files by executing the corresponding `.ipynb` notebooks, provided the input files are available and correctly structured.
